# Iron Dome Simulation

This is a simple Python simulation of an air defense system inspired by the Iron Dome. The program simulates the detection of incoming threats, assesses them based on their distance, and decides whether to intercept or ignore them.

## Features

- Simulates the detection of multiple incoming threats.
- Assesses threats based on their distance from the defense system.
- Implements interception logic for threats deemed dangerous.
